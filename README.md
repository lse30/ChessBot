# ChessBot
Bot that plays chess

WIP - initially only makes random moves 

+ added a basic display

+ added checking for checks
+ added FEN imports
+ moves/blocks checks
+ added FEN exports
+ added Castling

TODO

+ pawn promotions, en passant

+ position evaluations

+ AI using minimax a/b pruning


when it becomes functional I will create a chess.com account for it and test its rating.
